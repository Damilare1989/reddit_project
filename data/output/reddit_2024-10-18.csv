1g5zt6u, Frustrated with Support Tasks as a Data Engineer – Anyone Else?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a data engineer, and my main job should be building and maintaining data pipelines. But lately, I’ve been spending way too much time dealing with support tickets instead. My manager thinks it’s part of our role as the data team, but honestly, it feels like it’s pulling me away from the work I actually signed up for.

I get that support is important, but I’m feeling pretty frustrated and bored because this isn’t what I expected my day-to-day to look like. Meanwhile, the actual support team doesn’t seem to be handling these issues much.

1g6ijjk,Should managers discourage late-night work?,"The junior engineers on our sister team are regularly working long hours, often logging 4-6 extra hours at least once a week. We see evidence of them making mistakes and fixing them after failed tests, which shows up in the repo history and Slack alerts.

This team, which is more client-facing than ours (though still internal), frequently adds tickets mid-sprint and is constantly dealing with minor production issues. Their manager treats everything like a P0/P1 incident, and we've noticed he sometimes stays online late to approve PRs or even overrides failing CI tests.

Recently, their only staff engineer quit, which didn’t surprise us. He was expected to firefight constantly while also mentoring four junior engineers. But to be fair, there were probably other reasons too. 

What worries me most is that these juniors are being ""commended"" through Slack kudos and thank-you messages, but this situation feels unhealthy. I believe they're being taken advantage of, possibly because they’re too inexperienced to set boundaries.

Shouldn’t managers step in to prevent this?

We’re working on the data modernization project and use snowflake as our data platform and dbt for data transformation. We’re trying to build git flow branching to implement ci/cd pipeline. The current recommendation from the implementation company is feature—>dev—>qa—>prod—>main/master. We recommend to have a separate branch to cherry pick for any releases (everything goes to qa might not go to prod) and also a branch for hotfixes. During our internal meeting, a resource recommended to directly work on prod branch if incase of emergency production issues. I think I’m ok with that approach for snowflake, but not sure about dbt when you put untested code directly to prod branch.

The problem is that my former company was extremely non-technical and I was the only DE — operated exclusively with Google Cloud and had things running pretty well! But, my new company is the exact opposite, very technical and more standard in terms of DE infrastructure. 

Since joining, my imposter syndrome has kicked into overdrive…so much so that I’m really having a hard time feeling capable. It’s really the more technical pieces — Docker, GitHub Actions, credentialing, etc. that is causing me issues. 

I’d like to take some courses to learn more about standard DE practices, and to feel more capable on the job. My team uses Google Cloud a lot, so courses aligned with GCP seem appealing. But there’s just so much out there, and I’m not sure what would be my best bet. Ive looked through the Wiki here, as well as other sources, but I’m still not sure what would be most useful for my situation.

1g6defr,How to replicate data from AWS Aurora MySQL to Snowflake?,"Hi all,

We’re currently working on replicating data from AWS Aurora MySQL to Snowflake and looking for the best way to do this. One option that seems viable is reading the CDC binlog, but I’m not entirely sure of the steps to make this happen.

I’ve read that you can use AWS DMS to create files in S3 and then load those files into Snowflake. However, I’m unsure what the output files from DMS would look like. After files will be on S3, I assume I can idenitfy rows that was either updated or inserted and run query to upsert rows.

Our Aurora database is around 1TB, with about 50 tables, and a daily growth of 1-1.5GB. Given this, is there a better or more efficient way to keep MySQL and Snowflake in sync? Or is the CDC binlog method via DMS and S3 the best approach?

1g65owc,"Seeking Data Integration/Transformation Tool for Google Cloud (CDAP, NiFi, Databricks?)","
Hi everyone,

I'm a data engineer committed to Google Cloud, and I’m currently searching for a tool to integrate various data sources, transform the data, and load it into Google BigQuery. Ideally, I want a platform where I can orchestrate, integrate, and transform data in the same place, keeping everything organized.

I've tried Google Data Fusion, but it's on the expensive side, especially since I’m not dealing with large-scale data pipelines yet. I’ve also received management directives to avoid building custom solutions using Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, as the organization prefers a tool that reduces development and deployment complexity.

I'm looking into CDAP (open-source), which seems like a cost-effective alternative, but I don't see many users discussing or using it. Other options on my radar are Apache NiFi and Databricks (but this apperantly is in the expensive side too) . I would love to hear feedback from anyone who has used these tools, especially within a Google Cloud environment.

Are there any other tools I might have missed that could fit this use case? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

1g6fabb,I need some advice on my DWH architecture,"Hello everyone,

  
I'm posting here today because I have a question about my DataWarehouse architecture. 

  
I have an ELT architecture. To sum up:

1. Source: Multiple MSSQL databases
2. DWH: Postgres standalone
3. Orchestrator: Airflow
4. Worker: Apache Spark Connect

  
My DBS are: RAW -> GOLD -> DATAMART

I'm using Airflow to orchestrate PySpark functions that I pass as a task.pyspak inside Airflow.

Everything is dockerized.

My tables are relatively light, with some tables going up to 20Gb at maximum, which is fairly enough for Postgres in my opinion.

  
My problem is that okay, everything works fine, but SparkConnect is tricky:

I'm using Spark Connect with no worker, only the driver. Which is really overkill, but necessary for my DWH init (which I automated in case of a DWH failure and autosave failure). I also write data to parquet in a shared Docker Volume in order to pass data between my Airflow Tasks.

When I connect Spark Connect to a Spark master with worker, I cannot use some feature of Spark like df.count() because it uses RDD, even though it's labeled as SparkConnect compatible in their documentation.

So, maybe am I doing something wrong? Am I using SparkConnect the wrong way?

For tables of this size, are other tools maybe better fitted?

1g69qtt,Best way to monitor S3 and load new data into PostgreSQL?,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I’m looking for advice on the cheapest yet still performant way to monitor changes in an S3 bucket and then automatically load any new or changed data into my PostgreSQL database.

Here’s a quick overview of my setup:

* I’m currently using R with the [{targets}](https://github.com/ropensci-books/targets/) library to track changes to source files and manage downstream dependencies. Modern R is an absolute joy to use, and {targets} works well for smaller datasets while providing great observability into what needs to be rematerialized over time, but it’s struggling with the \~100k source files in my S3 bucket. Right now, I’m running a backfill on \~10k files, and it’s taking more than a day to complete.
* I self-host both my compute and PostgreSQL database servers, so I want to avoid cloud services for computation and storage.
* S3 serves as my data lake, where the source data is manually uploaded daily by data owners.
* My background is in data science/R, but I’m interesting in learning more data engineering best practices to improve my Python skills.

I think a batch processing solution would be sufficient for this project, as I don’t need a fully fledged streaming setup.

I’d love to hear what tools, workflows, or best practices you’d recommend for efficiently monitoring large S3 buckets and loading new/changed data into PostgreSQL—while keeping costs low. Some tools that have caught my eye are Dagster, dlt, and DuckDB, but I’m still trying to wrap my head around how these tools could work together.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
